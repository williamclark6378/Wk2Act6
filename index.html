                <li>Bears are extraordinarily intelligent animals. They have far superior navigation skills to humans; excellent memories; large brain to body ratio; and use tools in various contexts from play to hunting.</li>
                <li>Bears grieve deeply for others. Cubs are known to moan and cry when separated from their mothers.  This can go on for weeks if their mothers are killed by hunters.</li>
                <li>Bears have excellent senses of smell, sight and hearing. They can smell food, cubs, a mate or predators from miles away. Their great eyesight allows them to detect when fruits are ripe.</li>
                <li>Some species of Asiatic bear build nests in the trees. They can use these for hiding, eating and even sleeping.</li>
                <li>Bears care deeply about family members. They will risk their lives and even fight to the death in order to save a cub or sibling from danger.</li>
                <li>The bear is a common national personification for Russia (and the former USSR) and Germany. The brown bear is Finlandâ€™s national animal.</li>
